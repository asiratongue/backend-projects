(but idk I'm not a mathematician)\r\n\r\nthese same higher realms and experiences are accessed by the coder in the abstraction/ actual programming phase in a similar way,\r\nbut when it is built, or when one places their thought on the bigger picture of what they are building and bringing into the real world instead of the logic and the beauty of the puzzle pieces,\r\none is looking at creativity in the flesh.\r\n\r\nsame way, when one creates a piece of music, the \"flesh\" part is manifested in the listeners, and the life that the music creates itself, as a result of the shaping of the character, beliefs and traits of the person(s) it influences.\r\nmusic is nothing less and nothing more than self hypnosis, done through bonding deep, perhaps the deepest and most ineffable emotions if able to be brought about, with a persona/character to match.\r\n\r\nreading back, I don't think self hypnosis is the right word, it is more like, awareness, god, itself, changing life to suit the needs of the creator (of the music, or the music listening experience).\r\n\r\nanyways,\r\nonce this bond is set in stone, between human and god,\r\nthe enchanted listener will do anything to protect and validate that identity, regardless of when the last time they heard that song/piece from.\r\n\r\nonce the bond is set in stone, between human and god,\r\nthere is nothing anyone can do but watch, as the universe responds to such deep and intense feelings very positively, eventually, the person(s) attract what they felt or saw in the music in the first place.\r\n\r\nso, my friend, now the question doesn't remain.\r\ncreativity is god him/herself, changing reality in an instant; this is the way higher realms of creativity manifest, instant liberation, instant joy, love and radiance no matter how bleak or depressing the situation is, or how sharded the ego might be.\r\n\r\nso long as this energy / \"God\" stays present, and there is a two way connection, one allows reality to be transmuted into radiance and beauty day by day, with ease.\r\n\r\nThus, the same creativity in the flesh that is manifested at a high rate (depending on the skills of the programmer lol), will manifest for what can evoke in you your deepest feeling.\r\nit will take more time though, than programming a simple flask based barebones blog lol.\r\n\r\nreally, ones life is just about searching, until you can find something that can bring this out, or rather, if you want to get really metaphysical oooga booga, \r\nsomething that can open the channel from your higher energy centres down into your lower energy centres. and take care of them. \r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nand i think this is perhaps why humans came down to earth, from being whatever the fuck we actually are before we were born.\r\n\r\ni could go on for hours, i will read this over, and collect my thoughts for the next article, whenever the time is right.\r\n\r\naint it crazy though how some people are just channels/antennas for creativity, feelings are truth, thats why I tell the fucking truth, even when i lie, i am being true to my feeling of wanting to dissent and rebel in a new Machiavellian way.\r\n\r\nthis is why the chinese are on top, they understand this well, and maybe the indians too.\r\n\r\n", "id": 5}
